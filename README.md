## Description
Conway's PlayGround is the hub for all things related to [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Conway's PlayGround is a library of well-known lifeforms such as the Gosper Glider Gun, a lifeform builder for making your very own projects, and a platform for sharing your creations and interacting with the Life community. We created Conway's PlayGround as we felt available libraries and builders for Life were lackluster. A main problem that we noticed was a lack of organization in lifeform libraries, as well as an overly simplified interface for building lifeforms. PlayGround is the direct product to address these problems. We want a more fitting site for such a cool game, and that's what we've done!
